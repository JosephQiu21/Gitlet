# Gitlet

A version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system Git. Final project of CS61B (Data Structures) @UC Berkeley.

This Gitlet system support:

1. **Committing**: saving the contents of entire directories of files.

2. **Checking Out**: restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits.

3. **Logging**: viewing the history of your backups.

4. **Branching**: maintaining related sequences of commits.

5. **Merging**: merging changes made in one branch into another.

6. **Remote features**: managing and operating remote repositories.
